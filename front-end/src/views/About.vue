      <li>400 Miles in the Appalaichain Mountains</li>
      <li>100 Miles across Utah</li>
      <li>100 Miles in the Rocky Mountains</li>
      <li>Other Hikes here and there</li>
      <li>Countless National Parks</li>
    </ul>

    <p> It was in these moments in nature that he found his passion for the outdoors, and wanted to get everyone out and about!</p>
    <p> However, he knew that the first experience was the most important for any hiker or camper.</p>
    <p> He began designing guides for anyone and everyone interested in Camping and Hiking!</p>
    <p> And thus was founded <u>Trace Hale Hiking</u>!</p>
